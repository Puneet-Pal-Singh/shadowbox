# Portability Boundary Conformance Gate
#
# Validates that code changes maintain portability boundary adherence.
# Prevents platform leakage and ensures port contracts are honored.
#
# Run as: pnpm gate:portability-boundary
#
# Checks:
# 1. TypeScript compilation succeeds (strict mode)
# 2. Conformance tests pass (port contracts)
# 3. No Cloudflare primitives leak into core
# 4. Port boundary violations detected and reported
#
